# XCS224N Code Repository
This repository contains all submitted code for NLP assignments!

# Assignment 1
This has implemented a co-occurence based word embedding model.
- Changes Done : Compute Co-occurence Matrix and Truncated SVD to reduce K dims.

# Assignment 2
This has implemented the word2vec model and train word vectors using Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Implemented : Sigmoid(), naive softmax loss and gradient for skip-gram model,SGD optimizer.

# Assignment 3
This has implemented Neural Dependency Parser using PyTorch with goal of maximising performance on the Unlabeled Attachment Score metric.
- Implemented : LEFT_ARC, RIGHT_ARC & SHIFT_ARC Transitions,embedding lookup and forward functions to implement the network.

# Assignment 4
This has implemented Neural Machine Translation using RNNs to convert Cherokee-to-English model.
Implemented : LSTM, Projection and Dropout initialisation, encoder, decoder

# Assignment 5
Transformer.
Implemented : In Progress.
